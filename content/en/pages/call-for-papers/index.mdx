  Lexicography in the age of AI.

  The first circular has just been announced.

With its theme **Lexicography in the Age of AI,** the conference aims to bring together professional lexicographers, linguists, publishers, researchers, software developers and anyone interested in dictionaries and their educational, cultural, political and social impact on everyday life. 

The conference will be organized as a hybrid event and while we encourage everyone to participate on-site, we plan to provide live streaming and recording of the event for registered participants. Please note that the authors are expected to present on-site though. 

The programme will include plenary lectures, parallel topic-related sessions, software demonstrations, presentations of new projects and young lexicographic professionals, pre-conference workshops, a book exhibition as well as social events. 

## Call for papers

Papers, posters, presentations of new projects and software demonstrations are invited on the topic “Lexicography in the Age of AI” as well as all lexicographically relevant topics including, but not limited to, the following fields: 

* Dictionary types and formats 

- Dictionary-making processes and methodology 

* Dictionary use and user needs  

- Corpora in lexicography  

* Phraseology and collocations  

- Lexicography and language technologies

The main topics are not meant to exclude any other lexicographic topic. Papers, posters, and demonstrations that are relevant to the congress, but do not fit into any of the above-mentioned categories, will be reviewed nonetheless and considered for presentation.
