---
The EURALEX 2026 Conference, **Lexicography in the Age of AI**, foresees a wealth of highly interesting programme items, grouped in thematic parallel sessions.&#x20;

The [first circular](/call-for-papers) has just been announced, and we are looking forward to offering the community a rich and tailored programme along the lines of the conference theme, such as:

* paper presentations,
* pralell thematic sessions
* software demonstrations,
* presentation of new projects and early career researchers,
* posters,&#x20;
* (pre-conference) workshops,
* a book fair, as well as
* keynote talks.

Additionally, next to the regular conference programme, a social programme will enable the conference participants to enjoy and get to see (at least bits of) Vienna.&#x20;
