Andreas Baumann is Assistant Professor of [Digital Linguistics](https://digiling.univie.ac.at/) at the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/en)’s Department of German Studies. His academic roles extended to visiting scholar positions at the University of Stellenbosch and the University of Turin, as well as teaching at AMU, Poznań, and serving as a guest researcher at the Austrian Center of Digital Humanities (ÖAW). With a multidisciplinary background in Linguistics, Mathematics, and Cognitive Science, Andreas focuses on modeling language evolution and change. He analyzes dynamical systems to theoretically model the evolution of linguistic elements like words and their semantics, while also empirically studying their dynamics using large-scale historical text corpora and psycholinguistic databases. Andreas has co-led two Digital Humanities projects, one exploring short-term semantic shifts in Austrian German through lexical networks and another one applying dynamic sentiment analysis to Austrian media data, and is currently PI of the project ‘[**Disentangling effects of digitization on linguistic diversity**](https://digiling.univie.ac.at/digilingdiv/)’.
