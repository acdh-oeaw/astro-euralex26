She began her career at Porto Editora, where she worked for several years on major dictionary projects—an experience that shaped the practical and editorial dimension of her work. She is currently President of the [Instituto de Lexicologia e Lexicografia da Língua Portuguesa](https://www.acad-ciencias.pt/eng/institutos/apresentacao-illp/) at the Lisbon Academy of Sciences, where she coordinates the [Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa](https://dicionario.acad-ciencias.pt/), the Vocabulário Ortográfico da Língua Portuguesa and specialised dictionaries.

She is also an Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the University of Porto and a researcher at [CLUP](https://www.up.pt/flup/en/research-innovation/research-units/clup/) (Centre for Linguistics of the University of Porto). She holds a PhD in Translation and Terminology (specialisation in Terminology) from NOVA University Lisbon and a degree in Portuguese Studies from the University of Porto.

At the [Lisbon Academy of Sciences](https://www.acad-ciencias.pt/eng/), she leads the project ACL+ – Linguagem, Cultura e Inclusão Digital, funded by La Caixa, which promotes universal access to Portuguese lexicographic resources and strengthens digital inclusion. She collaborates with ISO on lexicographic data modelling, contributes to DARIAH working groups, and co-leads WG1 of [ENEOLI](https://eneoli.eu/members/), dedicated to developing a multilingual glossary of neology. Her research focuses on lexicography, terminology, digital lexical resources and TEI-based data modelling.
