## WHAT

The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) has begun to transform the ways in which lexicographic data are compiled, analysed, and presented. Large language models, advanced corpus tools, and other machine learning methods offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate tasks such as the extraction of lexical information, the induction of word senses, or the drafting of definitions. They also make possible new forms of user interaction, including conversational and personalized dictionaries that can adapt to different audiences or integrate multimodal content such as text, sound, and images. 

At the same time, these technologies pose serious challenges that go beyond purely technical concerns. Automatically generated content raises questions of reliability, bias, and transparency, while the integration of opaque systems into lexicographic workflows risks undermining scholarly standards of quality and accountability. The ecological impact of large-scale AI models must also be taken into consideration, raising doubts about their long-term sustainability in resource-intensive projects such as lexicography. Finally, the introduction of AI into the field invites reflection on the role of the lexicographer: how can human expertise remain central when automation is increasingly pervasive, and what kinds of collaborations between humans and machines are both effective and responsible? 

The conference **Lexicography in the Age of AI** will provide a forum for discussing these promises and risks. We will bring together professional lexicographers, publishers, researchers, software developers, and anyone interested in dictionaries to consider both the potential of AI for creating more dynamic, interactive dictionaries, and the ethical and ecological responsibilities that come with it.
